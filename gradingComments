Assignment 2 comments:

Question 1: Algorithms. 8/10 - better to express in terms of b & d.


Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - you're incrementing depth every time you dequeue, which will give
an inaccurate result. Better to make depth a member variable, and then child
depth=parent+1

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 15/15

count states: 2/5 - no summary table

Question 4: 0/10 - I don't see this part.

Question 5: 10/10
